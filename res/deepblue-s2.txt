In the first section of the article, the author describes the earlier iterations of Deep Blue, including descriptions of Deep Thought I and II. These descriptions explained how the Deep Blue team came to be and how Deep Blue evolved over time. It was not the first iteration by any means, and the evolution of the system is important to its success. The next few sections focused on the actual implementation iterations of Deep Blue. It started with the base system, focusing on chip and software limitations before moving to how these systems evolved. It focused a lot on how the chips worked together and how the hardware was made specifically for the purpose of predicting chess moves. Something especially interesting was that the team had to explore more abstract ways of viewing moves. This different view of moves was necessary since the Grandmasters that Deep Blue was playing against had deeper view of moves and different prediction and logic views. The later sections of the article talked about drawing on past experiences and data in order to make decisions during a game. It also discussed various additional constraints that were necessary for the system to be successful. Time constraints, and endgame plays were important for the system to beat as many players as it was able. The contributions from all of the various groups involved in Deep Blue are what made it so capable. From the primary team to contributors such as the various participating chess Grandmasters, the product was a great feat of engineering and thought from a large group of contributors to make it so successful for its time.
